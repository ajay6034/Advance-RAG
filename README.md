# Advance-RAG
Advanced RAG, it likely involves building a sophisticated system that leverages the retrieval-augmented generation approach with enhancements such as dynamic retrieval, multi-step reasoning, or other advanced techniques. This could involve:

1.Customizing the Retrieval Process: Implementing a tailored retrieval mechanism that optimally selects documents from a large corpus.

2.Optimizing Generation: Using fine-tuned language models that generate high-quality responses based on the retrieved context.

3.Iterative Feedback Loops: Incorporating user feedback or iterative refinement to continually improve the quality of retrieval and generation.
